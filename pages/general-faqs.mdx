## Overview
We are building this community to be inclusive and as diverse as possible across gender, sexuality, national origin, ethnicity, age, and artistic medium. The Workshop is where savants go to practice, learn, and grow their practice, and be surrounded by a global family of interdisciplinary artists.\
**Who**: The community brings together enthusiastic artists at all skill levels to meet, learn from, and create alongside each other.\
**What**: The community combines interactive online workshops, critiques, and group shows to help our members hone their craft. We invite world-class speakers for live Q&A sessions. Members promote each other through social media and engage in thoughtful conversations on a private discussion board.\
**Why**: This community is the best place on the internet to connect with artists and grow your career. We offer our members opportunities to interact with experts, grow their audience, and make work via intimate workshops and peer-to-peer support. We help members set up their studio practice for success with proven frameworks, and provide monetization of their work through projects and group shows.\
**Cost**: Membership is absolutely free, but in the future there will be areas of the server that will be token-gated.
