# Subscriptions
We love making Opera Quarterly. But the fact of the matter is that it takes hundreds of hours and dollars a month to sustain. Keeping it a clean, ad-free reading experience — which is important to us and, I hope, to you — means it's subsidized by the generous support of readers like you. So if you find any joy and stimulation in it, please consider a modest donation — however much you can afford, when it comes from the heart, it's the kind of gesture that makes us warm with appreciation. You can become a Supporting Member, joining the loyal readers who make Fameless Quarterly possible with an automatic monthly donation of your choosing:

    During your first week, you will be engaged in learning your new community and gaining access to the tips and channels that you will be using as a member of the server. On the server, we have our own bot. Its name is Fred from HR.

    We've also put together a Code of Conduct.

    By this time, you should know your way around the server. Like Olive Garden: When you're here, you're family. Hosting a fireside chat, playing a game of cee-lo, organizing weekly critiques will feel like second nature.
