## Manifesto

+ Talk about art plainly and simply. You shouldn’t need to have a masters in English literature to be able to have a discourse about art. Fameless wants to encourage discourse by making an accessible ecosystem to everyone who wants to contribute.

+ Provide a platform for underrepresented artists. Discovering both artists and artwork that could have slid under the radar. To help surface undiscovered artwork.

+ Finding “alternative funding” models for media production. Scale-out the art world by decentralizing the production and curation of a media platform. Can we use ‘web 3’ technology to facilitate this?

+ Take down barriers for people to read and learn about art. 

## Schedule & Format
Each week we publish interviews, essays, or columns featuring a different type of working artist’s wisdom. We also occasionally publish essays, reports, and zines—all of which are intended to help illuminate what it takes to survive and thrive as a creative person today.
