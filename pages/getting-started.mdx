We hold $FWB tokens to collectively fund and govern our community endeavors and co-own what we create, together. 

At our core, we are a growing social DAO with more than 3,000 members—including artists, builders, and thinkers from across various Web3 and cultural sectors. Collectively, we aim to catalyze the power of Web3 as a tool for creating and making things happen.

Since our inception in 2020, FWB has become a model for how a DAO can produce a diverse array of events, collaborations, and products that serve our community's needs while pushing culture forward.

This FWB Wiki will serve as a knowledge base for all members to cover many questions about how the DAO operates – from our membership application process, to tokenomics, community software and more. This Wiki was developed to serve as a relevant source of information for both new and longtime members. As DAO evolves and changes, so will this document, so check back here regularly for updates. 

Do you have a question about something that isn’t here or did you think of something that would be useful to add for other members? You can drop a note in our [Wiki Public Works channel](https://discord.com/channels/749418486874243212/1013946776904015932) to give us feedback.
