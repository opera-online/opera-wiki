I'm the founder and intern at CUSN. I grew up in that sweet spot of remembering most of my analog childhood but growing up alongside the internet. With strict parents, I escaped into the world wide web as a middle schooler that helped me forge skillsets (coding, communities, blogging) that help me every day today.
